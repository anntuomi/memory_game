# memory_game
A simple cmd memory game and my first personal java project.

This is my first java project I made in the summer of 2019 after my Hive Helsinki trial period. I haven't had time to finish it and it still lacks some key things.

To do:
- Add error handling
- Make it support different board sizes
- Needs some code cleaning
- Allow exiting mid-game
